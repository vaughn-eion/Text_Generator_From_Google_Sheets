# Text_Generator_From_Google_Sheets
Generate text from data imported from a google sheet.

## Background
I was sending a ton of emails everyday to companies and recruiters for my job search. Instead of copying and pasting into my email template, I thought why not just create a Python script to do that job for me.

## Approach to the problem
The biggest problem for this project was how do I connect to Google Sheets where I have all of my data that I need. Once I found that you could use Google Clouds API and authentication I was able to find what I needed to connect and grab the needed data.

## Final solution
The final solution for this project uses a combination the Google Sheets API and Pandas to output text to the console so I could automate the creation of my emails.
